      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an aquatic ecologist interested broadly in water quality, environmental change, and data science. My research focuses on ecosystem resilience and regime shifts, algal blooms, and metabolism. I&amp;rsquo;m currently a Physical Scientist with the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Previously I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with Hilary Dugan and Paul Hanson at the University of Wisconsin Center for Limnology. I completed my Ph.D. in the Pace Lab at the University of Virginia Department of Environmental Sciences and my B.</description>

      <description>Ecosystem Resilience &amp;amp; Regime Shifts Ecosystems are subject to constant pressure and disturbances from natural sources and human impacts. Resilience is the ability of an ecosystem to recover to its original state following a disturbance. Gradual or sudden decreases in ecosystem resilience can result in regime shifts - abrupt changes in the state of an ecosystem, due to transistions in the feedbacks that control system dynamics. These changes often seem to arise without warning, but theory suggests that regime shifts in a wide range of systems are preceded by predictable changes in system statistical properties.</description>
